    docs: add article for Manually Building Custom Theme (#8416)
    
    We recommend using UI Theme Designer for custom theme creation, however not everyone has access to the tool.
    The newly created article aim to assist them.
    
    The article describes the flow from finding and taking the Less sources, changing the Less variables, and compiling them to produce the customized CSS variables to finally using them.
