    feat(ui5-product-switch-item): added image slot (#11965)
    
    There is a new `image` slot which can be used instead of the old `icon` property.
    
    Also a new entry is added in the `AvatarColorScheme` enum called `Transparent` in order to achieve the target design for the transparent images/SVGs in the ProductSwitchItem with image.
