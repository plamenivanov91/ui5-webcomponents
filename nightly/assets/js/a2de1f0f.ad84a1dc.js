Over the past three years, we have listened to our community, refined our technologies, and expanded our capabilities. \\n\\n![UI5 Web Components timeline](./img/ui5webcomponents_timeline.png)\\n\\nOur project has continuously evolved, embracing new web standards, eliminating legacy code, and integrating invaluable user feedback from our community to enhance our APIs. This journey culminated in April with the unveiling of the first Release Candidate for UI5 Web Components 2.0.\\n\\n## Announcing UI5 Web Components 2.0! \ud83c\udf89 \\n\\nToday, we stand at a pivotal moment in our evolution with the official launch of UI5 Web Components 2.0. This major release marks a new era, enhancing performance and reliability while setting the stage for future innovations. Our commitment to growth and providing cutting-edge tools for web development ensures we continue to meet the evolving needs of our community.\\n\\n**Key Benefits of UI5 Web Components 2.0**\\n\\nUI5 Web Components 2.0 introduces several substantial improvements: \\n\\n- Embracing New Standards: Future-proofing UI5 Web Components. \\n\\n- Consistent APIs: Streamlined and more intuitive, albeit with some breaking changes. \\n\\n- Elimination of Legacy Code: Reducing footprint and enhancing quality by minimizing bugs.  \\n\\nLooking ahead, we will adhere to Semantic Versioning and release major updates more frequently to keep pace with technological advancements. \\n\\n## What\'s New in UI5 Web Components 2.0? \\n\\n### **Revolutionary Popover API**\\n\\nExperience a standardized, consistent, and flexible mechanism for displaying popover content across all relevant components.  \\nThis API allows popups to display correctly above all other content, eliminating the need for the \\"static area\\" used in version 1.x. Previously, popups were placed in a static area within the body to ensure correct positioning despite various CSS rules. In version 2.x, the [popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover) simplifies the DOM structure by incorporating the popover directly within the component. This results in easier development, maintenance, and enhanced styling capabilities. It also allows components with popups to have physical children, supporting custom content and simplifying testing. The popover API is fully supported by all major browsers. Discover all the practical benefits in our [blog post](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/releases/popover-api-in-v2/).\\n\\n### **Form-Associated Custom Elements**\\n\\nHarness the power of native input behavior within HTML forms. This enhancement makes the features/InputElementsFormSupport.js feature redundant, simplifying form handling and enhancing the developer experience. Refer to the [ElementInternals API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementInternals) for more details. \\n\\n### **Seamless Time Zone Support**\\n\\nSeamlessly manage time zones within your applications for a more personalized user experience. The date and time components are adapted to the time zone feature, allowing the components to present dates in different time zones. The time zone identifiers format is the one used in the IANA time zone database. See a [sample](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/DateTimePicker/#timezones) on our website.\\n\\n### **New Components**\\n\\nExpand your UI toolkit with new components such as Dynamic Page, Form, Table, Text, Tokenizer, AI Button, and AI Prompt Input. \\n\\n- [Dynamic Page](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/fiori/DynamicPage/): A layout component, representing a web page, consisting of a title, a header with dynamic behavior, a content area, and an optional floating footer. Use the Dynamic Page if you need to have a title, that is always visible and a header, that has configurable Expanding/Snapping functionality. \\n- [Form](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/Form/): The `ui5-form` is a layout component that arranges labels and form fields (like input fields) pairs into a specific number of columns. And, there is also \\"grouping\\" available to assist the implementation of richer UIs. The Form component reacts and changes its layout on predefined breakpoints.\\n- [Table](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/Table/): The `ui5-table` component provides a set of sophisticated features for displaying and dealing with vast amounts of data in a responsive manner. This Table replaces the previous Table web component, that has been part of @ui5/webcomponents version 1.x. For compatibility reasons, we moved the previous Table implementation to the `@ui5/webcomponents-compat` package and will be maintained until the new Table is experimental.\\n- [Text](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/Text/): The `ui5-text` component displays text that can be used in any content area of an application. By default, the text will wrap when the space is not enough. In addition, the component supports truncation via the max-lines property, which defines the number of lines the text should wrap before it starts truncating.\\n- [Tokenizer](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/Tokenizer/): A `ui5-tokenizer` is an invisible container for `ui5-tokens` that supports keyboard navigation and token selection.\\n- [AI Button](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/ai/Button/): The `ui5-ai-button` component represents a button used in AI-related scenarios. It enables users to trigger actions by clicking or tapping the ui5-ai-button, or by pressing certain keyboard keys, such as Enter.\\n- [AI Prompt Input](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/ai/PromptInput/): The `ui5-ai-prompt-input` component allows the user to write custom instructions in natural language so that AI is guided to generate content tailored to user needs.\\n- [Custom Option](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/OptionCustom/): The `ui5-option-custom` component defines a custom content of an option in the `ui5-select`. The component accepts arbitrary HTML content to allow full customization.\\n- [Custom Suggestion Item](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/SuggestionItemCustom/): The `ui5-suggestion-item-custom` is a type of suggestion item, that can be used to place suggestion items with custom content in the input. \\n- [Notification List](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/fiori/NotificationList/): The `ui5-notification-list` web component acts as a container for `ui5-li-notification-group` and `ui5-li-notification`, delivering the new SAP Design Notification experience.\\n- [List Group](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/components/ListItemGroup/): The `ui5-li-group` is a special list item used exclusively for creating groups of list items within a `ui5-list`.\\n\\n![Preview of UI5 Web Components 2.0 new components](./img/new_components_v2.png)\\n\\n### **Enhanced Existing Components** \\n\\nBenefit from improvements in List Drag and Drop, Tree Drag and Drop, Tab Container Drag and Drop, and a revamped Notifications Experience. \\n\\n![Preview of UI5 Web Components 2.0 new features](./img/new_features_v2.png)\\n\\n:::note\\n\\nFor the full list of changes, please refer to the release [change log](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/releases).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n### **Revamped Documentation Site**\\n\\nExplore our new documentation site featuring a live editor, playground, dark mode, and an intuitive icons view. \\n\\n![UI5 Web Components 2.0 new website](./img/website.png)\\n\\n**New logo**: We are excited to introduce our new symbol and branding, reflecting the modern and dynamic nature of our project.

This includes code logic, HTML and CSS.\\n\\n### Enhanced overstyling capabilities for apps\\n    - We can now provide [CSS Shadow Parts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shadow_parts) also for the \\"popup part\\", not just in the \\"main part\\" of the component!\\n    - [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) set on the component will also have effect for its \\"popup part\\"!\\n\\nConsider the following example:\\n\\n```html\\n<body>\\n    <style>\\n        #mc::part(root) {\\n            background: blue;\\n        }\\n        #mc::part(list) {\\n            margin: 0.5rem;\\n        }\\n    </style>\\n\\n    <my-component id=\\"mc\\">\\n        #shadow-root\\n            <div part=\\"root\\"></div>\\n            <ui5-popover>\\n                <ui5-list part=\\"list\\"></ui5-list>\\n            </ui5-popover>\\n    </my-component>\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nSince the popover is now part of the component, component authors can provide CSS Shadow Parts for elements in the popover, in addition to the existing CSS Shadow Parts.\\n\\n### Components with popups can now have physical children\\n\\nWeb components with popups had a **hard limitation** of not being able to slot children to the popup.\\n\\nExample of `ui5-select`\'s (simplified) DOM structure in **v1.24**:\\n\\n```html\\n<body>\\n    <ui5-static-area>\\n        <ui5-static-area-item> \x3c!-- static area item of the ui5-select --\x3e\\n            #shadow-root\\n                <ui5-responsive-popover> \x3c!-- the \\"dropdown\\" part of the ui5-select --\x3e\\n                    <ui5-list> \x3c!-- the list inside ui5-select\'s dropdown --\x3e\\n                        <ui5-li text=\\"Option 1\\"></ui5-li> \x3c!-- list item for the 1st ui5-option --\x3e\\n                        <ui5-li text=\\"Option 2\\"></ui5-li> \x3c!-- list item for the 2nd ui5-option --\x3e\\n                        <ui5-li text=\\"Option 3\\"></ui5-li> \x3c!-- list item for the 3rd ui5-option --\x3e\\n                    </ui5-list>\\n                </ui5-responsive-popover>\\n        </ui5-static-area-item>\\n    </ui5-static-area>\\n\\n    .........\\n\\n    <ui5-select>\\n        #shadow-root\\n            <div></div> \x3c!-- The \\"box\\" part of the select --\x3e\\n\\n        <ui5-option>Option 1</ui5-option>\\n        <ui5-option>Option 2</ui5-option>\\n        <ui5-option>Option 3</ui5-option>\\n    </ui5-select>\\n\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nAs you can clearly see from the example, there is no way to **slot** the `ui5-option` components into the `ui5-list` as it is in a completely different part of the DOM, due to the need for a static area.\\nInstead, we can only provide **logical** `ui5-option` components and just use their **text content** for the `text` property of the list items (`ui5-li`) in the static area.\\n\\nExample of `ui5-select`\'s (simplified) DOM structure in **v2.0**:\\n\\n```html\\n<body>\\n    <ui5-select>\\n        #shadow-root\\n            <div></div> \x3c!-- The \\"box\\" part of the select --\x3e\\n            <ui5-responsive-popover> \x3c!-- the \\"dropdown\\" part of the ui5-select --\x3e\\n                <ui5-list> \x3c!-- the list inside ui5-select\'s dropdown --\x3e\\n                    <slot></slot>\\n                </ui5-list>\\n            </ui5-responsive-popover>\\n\\n        <ui5-option><strong>Option</strong> 1</ui5-option>\\n        <ui5-option><ui5-icon name=\\"accept\\"></ui5-icon> Option 2</ui5-option>\\n        <ui5-option><i>Option 3</i></ui5-option>\\n    </ui5-select>\\n\\n</body>\\n```\\n\\nNow that the popover is part of the `ui5-select` itself, it\'s possible to have **physical** `ui5-option`s and slot their content directly into the popover or its children (`ui5-list` in this example).\\n\\nThis allows us to provide support for **custom user content** for components that had strict predefined APIs in the past!\\n\\n### Easier testing for both apps and component package authors\\n    - Tests no longer need to know how to find the static area item, associated with a given component - everything is directly in the shadow root!\\n    - Writing tests is much simplified.\\n\\n### Cross-framework popup compatibility for the future\\n    - Frameworks who use the native browser popover API no longer need to synchronize themselves (negotiate `z-index` values, etc.).\\n    - The last popup to be opened will always be on top (guarnateed by the browser)!\\n\\n## When can I start using it?\\n    - The current versions of all supported browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, and now also Firefox as of version 125) fully support the popover API. [See Can I Use report](https://caniuse.com/?search=popover).\\n    - By the time **v2.0** is officially released (we are at **v2.0-r.c.2** as of writing this blog post) we expect that each major browser will have already released at least 3 stable versions since the introduction of the popover API.\\n\\nMake sure to check our blog for future announcements, including the official release date of **UI5 Web Components 2.0**!"},{"id":"/releases/announcing-rc-v2","metadata":{"permalink":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/releases/announcing-rc-v2","source":"@site/blog/releases/announcing-rc-v2.mdx","title":"UI5 Web Components 2.0 Release Candidate is out!","description":"U5 Web Components project has reached a pivotal stage in its evolution, geared to embrace new standards, eliminate legacy code, and integrate consumer feedback to enhance our APIs, culminating in the highly anticipated major release, version 2.0.","date":"2024-04-18T10:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 18, 2024","tags":[{"label":"release","permalink":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/tags/release"},{"label":"v2","permalink":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/tags/v-2"}],"readingTime":4.44,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"UI5 Web Components 2.0 Release Candidate is out!","tags":["release","v2"],"slug":"/releases/announcing-rc-v2","date":"2024-04-18T10:00"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Popover API in UI5 Web Components 2.0","permalink":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/releases/popover-api-in-v2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Preparing for UI5 Web Components 2.0","permalink":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/blog/releases/preparing-for-v2"}},"content":"export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (\\n  <span\\n    style={{\\n      backgroundColor: color,\\n      borderRadius: \'5px\',\\n      color: \'#fff\',\\n      padding: \'0.1rem\',\\n    }}>\\n    {children}\\n  </span>\\n);\\n\\n# UI5 Web Components 2.0 Release Candidate is out!\\n\\nU5 Web Components project has reached a pivotal stage in its evolution, geared to embrace new standards, eliminate legacy code, and integrate consumer feedback to enhance our APIs, culminating in the highly anticipated major release, version 2.0. \\n\\nToday we are extremely happy to announce **UI5 Web Components 2.0 Release Candidate**! \ud83e\udd73\ufe0f\\nThe following `2.0` RC versions have been released:\\n- [2.0.0-rc.0](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.0) (2024-04-09)\\n- [2.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.1) (2024-04-11)\\n- [2.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.2) (2024-04-18) \\n- [2.0.0-rc.3](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.3) (2024-05-10)\\n- [2.0.0-rc.4 ](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.4) (2024-05-29)\\n- [2.0.0-rc.5](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc.5) (2024-06-06) <Highlight color=\\"#1877F2\\">latest</Highlight> \\n\\n\\n## What\'s new\\n\\n### New features\\n\\n- **Integration of popover API**: Enjoy standard, consistent and flexible mechanism for displaying popover content on top of other page content with the integration of the [`popover API`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover) across all relevant components: [#8192](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/pull/8192)\\n  \\n- **Time zone Support**: Date and time components are enhanced to seamlessly adapt to different time zones, ensuring accurate presentation of dates across various regions.
