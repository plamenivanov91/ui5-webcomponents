Instead, we can only provide logical ui5-option components and just use their text content for the text property of the list items (ui5-li) in the static area.  Example of ui5-select's (simplified) DOM structure in v2.0:  &lt;body&gt; &lt;ui5-select&gt; #shadow-root &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- The &quot;box&quot; part of the select --&gt; &lt;ui5-responsive-popover&gt; &lt;!-- the &quot;dropdown&quot; part of the ui5-select --&gt; &lt;ui5-list&gt; &lt;!-- the list inside ui5-select's dropdown --&gt; &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; &lt;/ui5-list&gt; &lt;/ui5-responsive-popover&gt; &lt;ui5-option&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option&lt;/strong&gt; 1&lt;/ui5-option&gt; &lt;ui5-option&gt;&lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;accept&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt; Option 2&lt;/ui5-option&gt; &lt;ui5-option&gt;&lt;i&gt;Option 3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/ui5-option&gt; &lt;/ui5-select&gt; &lt;/body&gt;   Now that the popover is part of the ui5-select itself, it's possible to have physical ui5-options and slot their content directly into the popover or its children (ui5-list in this example).

Use this component if you want to display relevant information that is not critical for users to complete a task. Users should have access to all the key functions and critical information in the app even if they do not see the side content. This is important because on smaller screen sizes it may be difficult to display the side content in a way that is easily accessible for the user.  When not to use?  Don't use it if you want to display navigation or critical information that prevents users from completing a task when they have no access to the side content.

Screen width &lt;= 1440px and &gt; 1024px  Main vs. side content ratio is 66.666 vs. 33.333 percent (with a minimum of 320px each). If the side content width falls below 320 px, it automatically slides under the main content, unless the app development team specifies that it should disappear.  Screen width &lt;= 1024px and &gt; 720px  The side content ratio is fixed to 340px, and the main content takes the rest of the width. Only if the sideContentFallDown is set to OnMinimumWidthand screen width is &lt;= 960px and &gt; 720px the side content falls below the main content.  Screen width &lt;= 720px (for example on a mobile device)  In this case, the side content automatically disappears from the screen (unless specified to stay under the content by setting of sideContentVisibilityproperty to AlwaysShow) and can be triggered from a pre-set trigger (specified within the app). When the side content is triggered, it replaces the main content. We recommend that you always place the trigger for the side content in the same location, such as in the app footer.  A special case allows switching the comparison mode between the main and side content. In this case, the screen is split into 50:50 percent for main vs. side content. The responsive behavior of the equal split is the same as in the standard view - the side content disappears on screen widths of less than 720 px and can only be viewed by triggering it.

It is slotted in the content of the ui5-card.  When a web component of ours is about to be defined and registered in the global CustomElements registry, the framework checks if some of the slotted children are custom elements by checking the presence of a hyphen (&quot;-&quot;) in their tag names. If this is true, the framework waits for the children to be defined and registered first, because the state or visual appearance of the parent may rely on the slotted elements/children.  While this is required in many cases, for custom HTML elements with pure semantic purpose and no JavaScript class attached (f.e. app-trip-calendar) - it's not. Moreover, it leads to increasing the time to render parameter of the given web component (f.e.ui5-card).

In HTML, you can define an element using a role. When you use semantic elements, you don’t need to define a role as these elements receive all relevant aria mappings out of the box. However, this is not the case when you use custom elements where you should add all relevant accessibility attributes yourselves.  This is not needed in UI5 Web Components, because when using our elements, all relevant accessibility attributes for a certain component will be applied in the shadow DOM, without further setup. Additionally, many accessibility-related APIs are available. They can be used to enhance the accessibility in the context of each application.  As the Web Components are a new standard, there are still some gaps in regard to accessibility. For example - setting IDRef relationships is currently not possible due to the nature of the custom elements and their shadow DOM. This is a limitation in the ARIA support and there is a draft of a new AOM (Accessibility Object Model), which addresses this issue and many more, and aims at a better JS-based accessibility support for all web elements. We are continuously working on improving the existing limitations.

Navigation with the keyboard and screen reader should work properly together. In order for this to happen, you need to use the correct ARIA attributes and to map them to their HTML counterparts. With UI5 Web Components, you will receive ARIA mapped elements out of the box. For example, let's add a ui5-combobox component:  &lt;ui5-combobox&gt; &lt;ui5-cb-item text=&quot;Item 1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-cb-item&gt; &lt;/ui5-combobox&gt;   By doing so, you receive an input element with role=&quot;combobox&quot; with all aria attributes relevant for this role in the shadow DOM. Also, if you set the disabled property, this will automatically add disabled to the shadow combobox element. Attribute mapping is available for all relevant properties - required, disabled, readonly, and more.  In order to ease the setting of aria attributes, we have introduced properties that are available for developers to extend the accessibility support in the context of the application. More information about the available properties could be found in the Accessibility APIs section below.

It marks the dynamic content changes as ARIA live regions so that you are able to inform the users of assistive technologies for a change that has happened to the UI.  The Invisible Messaging service is designed to be used both internally in the components logic and from the applications. Using the service, you have to specify the message to be announced by the screen reader and the mode which will be inserted in the aria-live attribute via the InvisibleMessage.announce(message, mode) method. The possible modes to choose from are:  InvisibleMessageMode.Assertive - indicates that updates to the region have the highest priority and should be presented to the user immediately.InvisibleMessageMode.Polite - indicates that updates to the region should be presented at the next graceful opportunity such as at the end of reading the current sentence, or when the user paused typing.  According to the WAI-ARIA recommendations, the live regions should be initialised empty when the page is loaded. This way screen readers remember them and start to listen for changes of their value. Thus, we recommend to instantiate Invisible Message as early as possible in the application. Then, you should specify the text that has to be announced by the screen reader and the live region mode using the announce method.

If, for example, your code may be loaded on demand by unknown applications as a third-party service, there is always the risk that the app or another third-party library, loaded by the app, may use an older version of UI5 Web Components which means that all custom elements will be upgraded with this version, while your code may rely on newer features.  Imagine the following integration scenario of an app, using several third-party libraries, loaded on demand (and not bundled with the app):  &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- Application code, using UI5 Web Components version 1.0.1 --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;application-container&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-title&gt;This is the new app with many third-party extensions!&lt;/ui5-title&gt; &lt;ui5-card&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Hello&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-input&gt;&lt;/ui5-input&gt; &lt;/ui5-card&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- Code inserted by &quot;common help&quot; library, using UI5 Web Components version 1.2.0 --&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;common-help-container&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-button-chlp new-button-prop=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Help Menu&lt;/ui5-button-chlp&gt; &lt;ui5-input-chlp value=&quot;Type your question&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-input-chlp&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;!-- Code inserted by &quot;global footer&quot; library, using UI5 Web Components version 1.3.0 --&gt; &lt;footer id=&quot;global-footer-container&quot;&gt; &lt;global-footer-main&gt; &lt;ui5-button-glob-foot new-button-prop=&quot;2&quot; even-newer-button-prop=&quot;3&quot;&gt;Profile&lt;/ui5-button-glob-foot&gt; &lt;ui5-link-glob-foot&gt;Contacts&lt;/ui5-link-glob-foot&gt; &lt;/global-footer-main&gt; &lt;/footer&gt; &lt;/body&gt;   In the example above:  The app itself is using an old version (1.0.1) of UI5 Web Components (which has already upgraded the ui5-card, ui5-button and ui5-input tags).The imaginary &quot;common help&quot; library, based on a newer version (1.2.0), uses the scoping suffix chlp.The imaginary &quot;global footer&quot; library, based on an even newer version (1.3.0), uses the scoping suffix glob-foot.  This allows the libraries to use new ui5-button properties such as newButtonProp and evenNewerButtonProp that are not found in older versions.

However, you have full control over which tags are scoped and which not. In the example above, tags starting with ui5-my- and tags having the word -test- in their name are not scoped.  Setting scoping rules is handy if, for example, your library uses both standard and custom UI5 Web Components and you don't want to scope the custom ones (as no disambiguation will be necessary for them).

Public properties belong to the application. Usually applications bind components' properties to a model. If a component changes its own public properties arbitrarily, the application model may get out of sync. Public properties may only be changed internally upon user interaction (in combination with firing an event).  Have I set noAttribute for private properties that are not used for CSS?  To keep the components' DOM simple, it's highly recommended to set noAttribute: true for all private properties that are not needed for CSS rules.  Does my CSS handle the default values for enum properties?  If a component is styled differently according to the value of an enum property, do not forget to write your CSS in a way that will apply the default styling even when the property is not set. For example, if you have a priority enum with values Normal (default) and Important, do not apply the default styles just for:host[priority=&quot;Normal&quot;], but also for simply :host.

In other cases, this is not necessary and making an event preventable would create unexpected user experience. Consider what makes the most sense in your particular use case.

Use the attribute notation: [ui5-button].accept-btn { color: green; } instead.  Similarly, if you have code such as this.shadowRoot.querySelector(&quot;ui5-popover&quot;), change it to: this.shadowRoot.querySelector(&quot;[ui5-popover]&quot;).  Have I imported and added to dependencies all components used?  All components used in the .ts and .hbs files of your component must be added to the dependencies metadata setting so that the compiler can scope them when converting the template to lit-html code.  Have I imported all icons that my component uses?  The test bundle imports all icons by default, but in a real-world scenario only icons imported by the app will be available. Therefore, each component should explicitly import the icons it needs.  Have I used instanceof checks for UI5 Elements?  Checks such as btn instanceof Button or el instanceof UI5Element are not safe, because when multiple versions of UI5 Web Components are on the same HTML page, the first to boot will upgrade all tags, and instanceof checks will only work with the first framework's classes and fail for all others.

Let's see the necessary files for a my-first-component component.  Class and template files​  The main files describing a Web Component are:  File\tPurposesrc/MyFirstComponent.js\tWeb Component class src/MyFirstComponent.hbs\tHandlebars template  In order to understand how a UI5 Web Component works and what lies behind these two files, read the next articles to understand more about Developing web components.  For the purposes of this tutorial, however, you don't need to understand their internals, as they are automatically generated by the script and are in a working state already.  Theming-related files​  A single set of CSS rules will be used for all themes. The only difference between themes may be the values of CSS Variables. Some CSS Vars, such as --sapBackgroundColor and --sapTextColor are standard and automatically managed by the framework. In addition, you can define your own CSS Vars and provide different values for them for the different themes. Set these CSS Vars in theparameters-bundle.css file for each theme. These files are the entry points for the styles build script.  File\tPurposesrc/themes/MyFirstComponent.css\tAll CSS rules for the Web Component, same for all themes; will be inserted in the shadow root. src/themes/sap_horizon/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_horizon theme src/themes/sap_horizon_dark/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_horizon_dark theme src/themes/sap_horizon_hcb/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_horizon_hcb theme src/themes/sap_horizon_hcw/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_horizon_hcw theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3 theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_dark/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_dark theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_hcb/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_hcb theme src/themes/sap_fiori_3_hcw/parameters-bundle.css\tValues for the component-specific CSS Vars for the sap_fiori_3_hcw theme  Note: It's up to you whether to put the CSS Vars directly in the parameters-bundle.css files for the different themes or to import them from separate .css files. You could have, for example, a MyFirstComponent-params.css file for each theme and import it into the parameters-bundle.css file: @import &quot;MyFirstComponent-params.css&quot;;.  Again, to know more about how these files work, you could have a look at the Developing Web Components section of the documentation.  i18n files​  You can define translatable texts as key-value pairs, separated by = in the messagebundle.properties file. Then you can provide translations for as many languages as needed.

A: Use this Stackblitz. Q: Where is the documentation? A: There are several resources: Web Components APIsHow to get started? Q: Is there a CDN to load UI5 Web Components from? A: No. The best practice is to build your own bundle. See this article for details. Q: Are UI5 Web Components APIs stable? A: Mostly yes since the project is in Release Candidate state, but minor changes may still be expected until the official release. Q: Can I create my own UI5 Web Components? A: Yes, for more information see Creating a Custom UI5 Web Components Package Q: How can I customize UI5 Web Components' styles? A: Read the Styling UI5 Web Components article. Q: How big is the runtime? A: Currently on main, a simple working Web Component (ui5-label) and its dependencies equals to around 22K gzipped. Two simple web components (ui5-label and ui5-icon) and their dependencies equal to around 25K gzipped. Note: The quoted numbers include only a &lt;ui5-label&gt; (respectively ui5-label and ui5-icon) working on Chrome/FF/Safari with the default settings (theme/language). Additional features, settings and old browser support will increase bundle size accordingly. Q: What is the difference between UI5 Web Components and OpenUI5? A: See the project's readme.md for more on this. Q: Can I use UI5 Web Components in an OpenUI5 application? A: This is not necessary as OpenUI5 already provides equivalents in the form of UI5 Controls. Q: How can I hide not yet upgraded Web Components so that users don't see them until styled? A: You can place a CSS rule such as: *:not(:defined) { display: none; } or: *:not(:defined) { visibility: hidden; } in your application, depending on your preference. The selector *:not(:defined) will match all web components that haven't been defined yet. Alternatively, you could only apply this rule for selected web components: ui5-button:not(:defined), ui5-label:not(:defined) { display: none; } Please note that the :defined CSS pseudo-selector is not supported by the Edge and Internet Explorer 11 browsers.","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Testing","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/docs/development/testing/","content":"","keywords":"","version":"Next"},{"title":"Prerequisites​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Testing","url":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/docs/development/testing/#prerequisites","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Install ChromeDriver​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Testing","url":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/docs/development/testing/#install-chromedriver","content":" ChromeDriver is a peer dependency of @ui5/webcomponents-tools.

This doesn't imply that the property can be explicitly set to null or undefined unless explicitly stated.  For instance, if the value property of the ui5-combobox component is defined as optional with the type string (value?: string). This indicates that the property can be set with a string value or be absent/omitted.  However, setting it explicitly to null might lead to runtime errors because the component might not handle null values correctly. To ensure proper handling of optional properties, TypeScript offers a feature we suggest enabling called &quot;Exact Optional Property Types&quot;. See https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#exactOptionalPropertyTypes . When enabled, TypeScript enforces stricter rules regarding optional properties, ensuring that they can only be assigned values that are explicitly allowed by the type definition.  For instance, consider the following interface:  interface UserDefaults { colorThemeOverride?: &quot;dark&quot; | &quot;light&quot;; }   Without &quot;Exact Optional Property Types&quot; enabled, TypeScript allows setting colorThemeOverride to dark, light, or undefined. However, enabling &quot;Exact Optional Property Types&quot; ensures that only these values are permitted, disallowing null or other unexpected values.  In summary, it's essential to ensure that the a property of type string is handled according to its type definition (for example, by setting empty string, instead of null, where type is string), and if necessary, enable &quot;Exact Optional Property Types&quot; in TypeScript to enforce stricter rules regarding optional properties.

They are only modified by properties and attributes.  An example of such a Web Component is the ui5-icon:  &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;add&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-icon&gt;   The icon accepts no text or other HTML elements inside its opening and closing tags. Therefore, in the next example, the text inside the &lt;ui5-icon&gt; will be ignored.  &lt;ui5-icon name=&quot;add&quot;&gt;This is an icon&lt;/ui5-icon&gt;   Other UI5 Web Components, such as &lt;ui5-button&gt; accept text (and in addition HTML elements that make sense when writing text).  &lt;ui5-button id=&quot;btn&quot;&gt;This is the content of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;content&lt;content&gt; of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;This is the &lt;span class=&quot;myClass&quot;&gt;content&lt;span&gt; of the button&lt;/ui5-button&gt;   You can change the content of these elements with any suitable DOM API.  const myButton = document.getElementById(&quot;btn&quot;); myButton.textContent = &quot;New text&quot;; myButton.innerHTML = &quot;New text&quot;; // same effect as above myButton.childNodes[0].nodeValue = &quot;New text&quot; // same result again   Usually, you'll never have to do this manually either, as you'll bind the content of the button via the means provided by the framework you're using, and the framework will be the one updating it for you.  Finally, there are UI5 Web Components that only accept other HTML elements.  For example &lt;ui5-popover&gt; may contain any HTML element - standard elements and other custom elements alike.  &lt;ui5-popover&gt; &lt;div&gt;This is my content&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is some more content&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Button on a popover&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/ui5-popover&gt;   Manipulating the content of such Web Components is done again with the standard DOM APIs.  For example, to add something else to the popover above:  const popover = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;ui5-popover&quot;)[0]; const newChild = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); popover.appendChild(newChild);   Again, normally you won't need to do this manually, but your framework will do it for you.  Now, let's have a look at a Web Component that is intended to have only certain children:  &lt;ui5-tabcontainer id=&quot;tc1&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Laptops&quot; additional-text=&quot;125&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;ui5-tab-separator&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab-separator&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Phones&quot; design=&quot;Positive&quot; additional-text=&quot;25&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;ui5-tab text=&quot;Tablets&quot; design=&quot;Negative&quot; additional-text=&quot;40&quot;&gt;&lt;/ui5-tab&gt; &lt;/ui5-tabcontainer&gt;   The &lt;ui5-tabcontainer&gt; should only contain &lt;ui5-tab&gt; and &lt;ui5-tab-separator&gt;.  The manipulation is exactly the same as with the other Web Components. For example, to add a new tab:  const tc = document.getElementById(&quot;tc1&quot;); const newTab = document.createElement(&quot;ui5-tab&quot;); newTab.text = &quot;Smart Watches&quot;; newTab.design = &quot;Positive&quot;; tc.appendChild(newTab);   And finally, some UI5 Web Components may render their children in different places, depending on the purpose of each child.  Let's have a look at the &lt;ui5-popover&gt; again. After consulting the documentation, we can see that this particular Web Component accepts three categories of children: default, footer, header. For footer and headerthe children can be any type of HTML Element (hence HTMLElement), while for default they can be both HTML Elements and text (hence Node).  To tell the &lt;ui5-popover&gt; which child goes where, use the slot attribute on it.  &lt;ui5-popover&gt; &lt;div slot=&quot;header&quot;&gt;This will be used as a header&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Some popover content&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Some more content&lt;/div&gt; This text will also go to the default slot. &lt;div slot=&quot;footer&quot;&gt; &lt;ui5-button&gt;Do some action&lt;/ui5-button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/ui5-popover&gt;   You do not have to supply the slot attribute for the default slot of any Web Component.  Also, since text nodes cannot have attributes in HTML, this also means that only the default slot can accept text (can be of type Node) and all text nodes go there. Every UI5 Web Component that has slots, has at least a default slot.  Here's a summary of slot types:  Slot Type\tAllowed Children\tExampleNode\tAll HTML elements and text\tui5-button default slot HTMLElement\tHTML elements only (no text)\tui5-popover header slot  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"4.

Like with most other tasks, you'll use your framework's syntax to bind to events, and you'll rarely, if ever, need to call addEventListener yourself.  Please, note, however that some frameworks (e.g. React) cannot use their standard syntax for binding to custom events (such as close), but only for standard ones (such as click).

For example, the following is not allowed:  &lt;{{tag}} {{attr}}=&quot;Hello&quot;&gt;This will not compile&lt;/{{tag}}&gt;   You can access object properties:  In the Demo.js file:  this.person = { name: &quot;John&quot;, lastName: &quot;Smith&quot; }   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;p&gt;{{person.name}} {{person.lastName}}&lt;/p&gt;   but you cannot use expressions inside .hbs templates. The following is not allowed:  &lt;p&gt;{{person.name + &quot; &quot; + person.lastName}}&lt;/p&gt;   Instead, you should precalculate the required value in the .js file and use it directly in the template:  In the Demo.js file:  get fullName() { return `${this.person.name} ${this.person.lastName}`; }   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;p&gt;{{fullName}}&lt;/p&gt;   By default, all content that you pass is escaped for security purposes. However, you can pass arbitrary HTML with {{{ and }}}:  In the Demo.js file:  this.unsafeMessage = `&lt;span&gt;This is unsafe content&lt;/span&gt;`;   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;p&gt;{{{unsafeMessage}}}&lt;/p&gt;   The result in DOM would be:  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is unsafe content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   Note: Using {{{ and }}} is strongly discouraged and should be avoided whenever possible. If you must use it, make sure you've sanitized your HTML manually beforehand. A common use-case for the {{{ and }}} binding is to manually add &lt;strong&gt; tags to parts of a string to implement highlighting while the user is typing. Here's an example:  In the Demo.js file:  this.userInput = `&lt;strong&gt;Arg&lt;/strong&gt;entina`;   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;div&gt;{{{userInput}}}&lt;/div&gt;   Thus, if the user has typed &quot;Arg&quot; (while typing &quot;Argentina&quot;), this part of the name will be highlighted.  Finally, it is possible to pass HTML elements (not just strings as in all examples above), and they will be rendered:  In the Demo.js file:  this.messageDiv = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;); this.messageDiv.textContent = &quot;Hello&quot;;   In the Demo.hbs file:  &lt;p&gt;{{messageDiv}}&lt;/p&gt;   The result in DOM would be:  &lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   Note: This is not to be confused with {{{ and }}}. The {{{ and }}} binding expects a string, containing HTML, while the example above demonstrates passing an HTML element (hence Object, not String) directly.  Note: Although this technique is allowed and has its uses (such as cloning slotted elements to another component), passing HTML directly is strongly discouraged. The best practice is to always write your HTML explicitly in the template.

The individualSlots slot metadata configuration setting (see the Slot section) allows you to have a separate physical slot for each child belonging to a certain slot.  However, setting individualSlots: true in the metadata configuration only creates an _individualSlot property on each element belonging to the slot, but does not create any slots automatically. The individual slots must be explicitly rendered by the developer in the .hbs template.  To do so, simply render a slot with a name property equal to the _individualSlot value for each child.  Here's an example:  In Demo.js (metadata object):  { slots: { &quot;default&quot;: { type: HTMLElement, propertyName: &quot;items&quot;, individualSlots: true } } }   Since propertyName is set to items, the children of the default slot will be accessible on the web component instance with this.items; and since individualSlots is set to true, every child in this.items (every child slotted in the default slot) will have an _individualSlots property created by the framework.  In Demo.hbs you must render a slot for each child with name equal to the _individualSlot property value for this child:  {{#each items}} &lt;div class=&quot;item-wrapper&quot;&gt; &lt;slot name=&quot;{{_individualSlot}}&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt; &lt;/div&gt; {{/each}}   The resulting DOM from the loop above will look like this:  &lt;div class=&quot;item-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;slot name=&quot;items-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;item-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;slot name=&quot;items-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;item-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;slot name=&quot;items-3&quot;&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   This allows you to have arbitrary DOM around each child and implement complex UX design, otherwise impossible if all children were just normally rendered next to each other in a single slot.

This is the reason why the toolbar must operate with abstract items. Abstract items are not rendered directly within the DOM; instead, they function as data used by the toolbar to produce corresponding physical web components. On the other hand, useful modifications detected by the toolbar on the physical items are synchronised with the abstract ones. (see step Events) The ui5-toolbar is a composite web component, that slots different UI5 components, designing them as abstract items. They can contain properties, slots and events, and they can match the API of already existing component. In order to be suitable for usage inside ui5-toolbar, each component should adhere to following guidelines:  The component needs to implement a class with component name of the following type:  ToolbarButton.ts   The new component needs to implement two template files with name of the following type:  ToolbarButton.hbs and ToolbarPopoverButton.hbs   It needs to implement customElement decorator, which is good to contain custom tag name:  @customElement({ tag: &quot;ui5-toolbar-button&quot; })   The class should extend ToolbarItem base class, which should also be added as a dependency.  class ToolbarButton extends ToolbarItem   Inside the module there should be two template getters: for toolbar and popover representation.  static get toolbarTemplate() { return ToolbarButtonTemplate; } static get toolbarPopoverTemplate() { return ToolbarPopoverButtonTemplate; }   After the class declaration there should be a registry call for the item inside the toolbar. registerToolbarItem helper should be added as a dependency.  import { registerToolbarItem } from &quot;./ToolbarRegistry.js&quot;;   registerToolbarItem(ToolbarButton);   In the templates there should be mapping of the properties that need to be used in the component inside Toolbar.  Inside ToolbarButton.ts:   @property() text?: string; @property({ type: Boolean }) disabled = false;    Inside ToolbarButtonTemplate.hbs:   &lt;ui5-button class=&quot;ui5-tb-item&quot; ?disabled=&quot;{{this.disabled}}&quot; data-ui5-external-action-item-id=&quot;{{this._id}}&quot; data-ui5-stable=&quot;{{this.stableDomRef}}&quot; &gt; {{this.text}} &lt;/ui5-button&gt;   The new component's DOM root element needs to have &quot;ui5-tb-item&quot; CSS class in order to get default styles for item (margins etc.).The new class needs to be added to the bundle file in the corresponding library.

The toolbar will actively monitor these events on the physical items, and when triggered, it will also fire the information to the corresponding abstract item. This mechanism proves useful when the abstract item requires synchronization of changes or interactions with the physical items. Importantly, events described as public offer benefits to consumers of the abstract items informing them about interactions with the physical elements. Additionally, the map contains information about the popover, such as preventClosing: true, which ensures that the popover remains open when this event is triggered by the physical item. A good example is the Map of the ui5-toolbar-select:   get subscribedEvents() { const map = new Map(); map.set(&quot;click&quot;, { preventClosing: true }); map.set(&quot;change&quot;, { preventClosing: false }); map.set(&quot;open&quot;, { preventClosing: true }); map.set(&quot;close&quot;, { preventClosing: true }); return map; }    The ui5-toolbar-select then waits for the toolbar to fire the change event, in order to notify (synchronize) its options slots:   _onEventHandler(e: Event): void { if (e.type === &quot;change&quot;) { // update options const selectedOption = (e as CustomEvent&lt;ToolbarSelectChangeEventDetail&gt;).detail.selectedOption; const selectedOptionIndex = Number(selectedOption?.getAttribute(&quot;data-ui5-external-action-item-index&quot;)); this.options.forEach((option: Option, index: number) =&gt; { if (index === selectedOptionIndex) { option.setAttribute(&quot;selected&quot;, &quot;&quot;); } else { option.removeAttribute(&quot;selected&quot;); } }); } }  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Migration Guides","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/ui5-webcomponents/nightly/docs/migration-guides/","content":"Migration Guides UI5 Web Components versioning is based on Semantic Versioning.
